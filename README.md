## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS variables

### What I learned

- That project made me learn about semantic HTML5

- Working with flexible display using the flexbox properties, positioning elements on the screen.

- Working with two-dimensional grid system display using the Grid properties, positioning elements on the screen.

- Working with external fonts (Google fonts) to improve a better custom apparence.

- Working with separated documents, improving organization and responsability to every document with its function in the whole project.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/reset.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/variables.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/style.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/styles/responsive.css" />
```

- Working with variables reducing the code and establishing a pattern easiest to manage.

```CSS
:root {
  --first-card: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
  --second-card: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
  --third-card: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);

  --white-paragraphs: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --background-headings-buttons: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
  --paragraph: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
  --heading: "Big Shoulders Display", cursive;
}
```
